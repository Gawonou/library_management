# Library Management System
# 📚 Library Management System – FastAPI, GraphQL, Redis, Celery 

This is a senior-level backend project that implements a robust, modular, and scalable **Library Management System**. Built entirely in Python using cutting-edge technologies, the system is designed for high performance, maintainability, and extensibility. It manages library resources such as books, users, borrow/return flows, and background tasks, all through a modern API-driven architecture.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Architecture

| Component         | Technology Used                         | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend Framework | **FastAPI**                             | High-speed, async-ready web framework                               |
| API Layer         | **GraphQL** (via Ariadne or Strawberry) | Flexible querying, efficient frontend integration                   |
| Database          | **PostgreSQL**                          | Persistent storage for users, books, loans                          |
| Caching           | **Redis**                               | Fast data access, reducing DB load (e.g., most-read books)          |
| Task Queue        | **Celery** + Redis                      | Background jobs (e.g., overdue reminders, report generation)        |
| Auth & Security   | **JWT (OAuth2)**                        | Secure authentication, role-based access (reader, librarian, admin) |
| Data Validation   | **Pydantic**                            | Strict schema enforcement and serialization                         |
| Testing           | **Pytest**                              | Unit and integration testing                                        |
| Deployment        | **Docker + Docker Compose**             | Containerized environment for portability and scaling               |

## 🧩 Main Features

- **User Management**: Register, log in, and manage users with role-based permissions.
- **Book Catalog**: Create, read, update, delete books; organize by author, category, availability.
- **Borrowing System**: Allow users to borrow available books and return them with tracking.
- **Late Returns**: Automatically calculate delays and potential penalties.
- **GraphQL Search**: Search by title, author, or keyword with advanced filtering.
- **Async API**: All endpoints are non-blocking and designed for high concurrency.
- **Caching**: Redis used to store frequently accessed queries (e.g., book lists).
- **Background Tasks**: Celery handles heavy operations like sending notifications or exports.

---

## ⚙️ Performance Optimization

- FastAPI’s async I/O improves performance under heavy load.
- Redis reduces unnecessary database hits via caching with TTL.
- Celery isolates long-running tasks to prevent blocking the main app.
- GraphQL reduces over-fetching by returning only required fields.
